# **Bank Customer Analysis and Insight Generation**

## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience in exploring, analyzing, and extracting meaningful insights from a real-world dataset. Using a bank customer dataset, this project focuses on identifying trends, patterns, and key insights related to customer behaviors such as churn, demographics, and factors influencing customer retention.

## **Project Overview**
The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Analyzing the dataset's structure, including data types, number of rows, columns, and variable relationships.
   - Checking for missing or incorrect data and handling it appropriately.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Creating multiple visualizations (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, etc.) to illustrate the relationships between features.

3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Computing basic statistical measures (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for relevant features.
   - Identifying and analyzing outliers in the dataset.

4. **Insight Generation**:
   - Based on data exploration and visualizations, generating insights to answer key questions such as:
     - What characteristics of customers are likely to churn?
     - Are there any patterns based on demographics (e.g., age, gender)?
     - What factors influence a customer's likelihood of leaving the bank?

## **Dataset Overview**
The dataset consists of customer information from a bank. It includes demographic details, account information, and a target variable indicating whether the customer has churned or not.

### Key features may include:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Gender**: Customer's gender.
- **Balance**: The account balance.
- **Product Type**: Type of banking product used.
- **Churn**: Whether the customer has left the bank (1 = churned, 0 = retained).
- **Tenure**: The number of years the customer has been with the bank.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: To manage and preprocess the dataset.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To document and execute the analysis.

## **Data Exploration**
- **Dataset Inspection**: Initially inspect the dataset to understand its structure, data types, and the number of missing or incorrect values.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Handle missing or incorrect values through techniques like imputation or deletion.

## **Data Visualization**
- Create visualizations to explore and analyze the relationships in the data, including:
  - **Histograms**: For distributions of numerical features like age, balance, and tenure.
  - **Bar Charts**: For categorical data like product type or churn status.
  - **Scatter Plots**: To explore relationships between features like age vs. balance, or tenure vs. churn.
  - **Correlation Heatmaps**: To visualize relationships between numerical variables and identify correlations.

---

## **Statistical Analysis**
- **Basic Statistics**: Calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of relevant features like age, balance, and tenure.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify outliers using statistical methods (e.g., z-scores or IQR) and explore their impact on the analysis.

---

## **Insight Generation**
- **Customer Churn**: Identify trends or characteristics of customers who are likely to churn, based on visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Demographic Patterns**: Analyze if customer age, gender, or other demographics influence churn.
- **Factors Influencing Churn**: Determine what features (e.g., balance, product type, tenure) seem to impact the likelihood of customer retention.

## **Outputs**
1. **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains all Python code, data cleaning, exploration, visualizations, and insights.
2. **Visualizations**: Various plots to demonstrate relationships and patterns in the data.
3. **Insight Report**: A summary of key findings and recommendations for the bank based on the analysis.
